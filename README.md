Nodejs XLSX READER / WRITER

Greetings, 

This program was created using the xlsx module : https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx?activeTab=readme

Install dependencies: 
```
$ npm install
```
To view the outputs of the data set from the xlsx file in your cli, run the command: 
```
$ node readSheet.js
```
To write the output to a new sheet in the workbook, run the command:
```
$ node writeSheet.js
```
To view the output in xlsx, drag the "testData.xlsx" file to your local machine after its been written. A new sheet should be visible with the expected output.

Thanks for visiting! happy hacking :)
