## Nodejs XLSX READER / WRITER

Greetings, 

This program was created using the xlsx module : https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx?activeTab=readme

Install dependencies: 
```
$ npm install
```
## READ SHEET

To view the outputs of the data set from the xlsx file in your cli, run the command: 
```
$ node readSheet.js
```
## WRITE SHEET

To write the output to a new sheet in the workbook, run the command:
```
$ node writeSheet.js
```

After running this command a new sheet in './testData.xlsx' will be created with the expected output.
